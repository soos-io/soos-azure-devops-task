# SOOS - Software security, simplified.
SOOS is an independent software security company, located in Winooski, VT USA, building security software for your team. [SOOS, Software security, simplified](https://soos.io).

Use SOOS to scan your software for [vulnerabilities](https://app.soos.io/research/vulnerabilities) and [open source license](https://app.soos.io/research/licenses) issues with [SOOS Core SCA](https://soos.io/products/sca). [Generate and ingest SBOMs](https://soos.io/products/sbom-manager). [Export reports](https://kb.soos.io/help/soos-reports-for-export) to industry standards. Govern your open source dependencies. Run the [SOOS DAST vulnerability scanner](https://soos.io/products/dast) against your web apps or APIs. [Scan your Docker containers](https://soos.io/products/containers) for vulnerabilities. Check your source code for issues with [SAST Analysis](https://soos.io/products/sast).
